This repository contains datasets which I have obtained through my course presided over by Professor Dr. Andreas Orth. 
In no way do I intend to use the data for commerical prurposes. All the included datasets in R Practice directory are solely the intellectual property of Professor Andreas Orth. 
The repository contains my own detailed interpretations of the tests, visualizations and analysis according to my understanding and perception.
