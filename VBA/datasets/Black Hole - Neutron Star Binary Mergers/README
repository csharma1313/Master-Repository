Gravitational radiation waveforms for black hole-neutron star
coalescence calculations. The physical input is Newtonian physics, an
ideal gas equation of state with varying compressibility (through the
index gamma), and point-mass gravitational radiation back reaction,
which is switched off in the simulation once the star is tidally
disrupted. All the simulations are 3D, done using SPH.


Files are labeled as waveform*BHNS.out, and this text is included in
the first line of the file. The format for the files is

t (sec)	    rh+ (cm)      rhx (cm)

where t is in seconds. The second and third columns contain the
amplitude, multiplied by the distance to the observer r, in CGS units
(i.e. this is (G/c^4)[factor of the second derivative of the moment of
inertia, in CGS units] ). The files are such that the waveforms computed
through the simulations are for t>0, while for t<0 the calculation is
the result of a matched point-mass inspiral. The total time is
approximately one second for each file. The reference for each file is
the paper where the results were first published.
